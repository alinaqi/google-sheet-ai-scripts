These are bunch of different scripts I use in Google Sheets to do different things eg. enriching profiles, matching data etc. I find it easier to do these in Sheets. 


To use them, simply go to Extensions > App Scripts and then add these scripts and run them. If you don't understand anything just go to Claude/ChatGPT and ask away :)
